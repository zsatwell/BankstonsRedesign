        <p class="text_content">
          The Bankston family has been in business for over 40 years. Rodney and
          Kay Bankston started Bankston Tire and Appliance in the early 70's.
          The business flourished under their leadership and when their sons
          Brent and Brad started to show interest in business they knew that
          they had the beginning of something unique. With the Tire and
          Appliance store still in full swing, Rodney realized that if anything
          was to ever "happen" to him, that a mother and two children could not
          continue to run the existing business. So in the early eighties as the
          boys got older and showed interest collecting, a natural business
          started to evolve.

        <p class="text_content">
          In 1985, Bankston's Used books was opened with a small comic and
          sports card selection in the store. Mostly hardback and paperback
          books at the time. Meanwhile the collectible industry was poised to
          explode as both comic books and baseball cards started to blossom.
          Brent and Brad fervently enjoyed the business and applied the same,
          character driven"customer first" attitude they were taught at the Tire
          and Appliance store to the their new business. Now, all these years
          later, we have Bankston's Sports Cards & Comics as well as Austin
          Books & Comics that staff good,friendly, knowledgeable people to
          continue on the tradition started all those years ago by Rodney and
          Kay Bankston.
